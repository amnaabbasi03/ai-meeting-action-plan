[10:00:01] Emma: Morning, everyone! Let’s dive in. First up: Q2 ad strategy.

[10:00:05] Rohan: I think we should double down on LinkedIn. Our last campaign had a 12% CTR.

[10:00:10] Alex: Totally agree. Also, YouTube engagement is growing — might be worth pushing there too.

[10:00:17] Emma: Noted. What about Instagram?

[10:00:19] Alex: Honestly, it’s underperforming. I’d recommend pausing it for this quarter.

[10:00:23] Emma: Makes sense. Okay, next — influencer outreach?

[10:00:27] Rohan: I’ll share a draft list with you all by Friday.

[10:00:30] Emma: Great. Alex, can you update the content calendar?

[10:00:33] Alex: Yup, I’ll get it done by Wednesday.

[10:00:35] Emma: Awesome. Thanks, everyone!
