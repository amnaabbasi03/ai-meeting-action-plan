# AI-Powered Meeting Action Plan Generator

AI Meeting Action Plan Generator is a simple web application that lets you upload meeting transcripts and automatically generates structured action plans using OpenAI's GPT models. It is built with Streamlit for easy deployment and user interaction.

## Overview
This tool is designed to help users quickly turn raw meeting transcripts into clear summaries and task lists. 
It extracts: meeting transcripts from Zoom, Google Meet, or Teams, and generates:

- ‚úÖ Clear action items (with owners and deadlines)
- üß† Key decisions
- üìù Summary bullets

Optionally, you can push the extracted tasks to a **Notion** task database.
